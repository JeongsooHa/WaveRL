# Hot_Start_RL
A package for efficient hot starting of RL agents in complex physical environments



## Setup
Clone repository and update python path
```
repo_name=Insight_Project_Framework # URL of your new repository

git clone https://github.com/$username/$repo_name
cd $repo_name
echo "export $repo_name=${PWD}" >> ~/.bash_profile
echo "export PYTHONPATH=$repo_name/src:${PYTHONPATH}" >> ~/.bash_profile

```
Create new development branch and switch onto it
```
branch_name=dev-readme_requisites-20180905 # Name of development branch, of the form 'dev-feature_name-date_of_creation'}}
git checkout -b $branch_name
```

## Initial Commit
Lets start with a blank slate: remove `.git` and re initialize the repo
```
cd $repo_name
rm -rf .git   
git init   
git status
```
